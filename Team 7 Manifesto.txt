A TEAM NEEDS TO VIBRATE THE SAME FREQUENCY TO BE WHOLE AND EFFECTIVE. LET'S FIRST TUNE OUR FREQUENCY TO ONE SAME CHANNEL.

1. Self-management: No one wants to be controlled. No one wants to be managed. But to achieve goals, we need to self-manage. Self-manage or be managed. Your choice!

2. Essentialism: Cut the crap, and say no to bullshit. Don't need to do what deemed unecessary. Don't need to learn what deemed unecessary. Don't need to listen to what deemed uncessary. Respect your time and resource. Time and resource can be always spent elsewhere when it is needed the most. 

3. Having some fun and learn some more: The brain, in a way, is biologically designed to be entertained and to chase excitement. If something is boring, the brain will fry and shut itself down. Students play video games (chase excitement) because they are bored and feel sleepy all the time (brain shutting down) because they are bored. People still wonder why? There is nothing we can do about it. Understand the brain and flow with the brain, not against it. Having some fun in what we do is extremely important because then we can learn some more. Take care of the brain and the brain will take care of you.
